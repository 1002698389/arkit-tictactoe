# arkit-tictactoe
Bjarne Lundgren / bjarne@sent.com / @bjarnel

In this example I have taken the simple scenekit tic-tac-toe (another of my repositories), and tried to put it in ARKit :-)
It works.. somewhat

This obviously requires, Xcode 9 (BETA), iOS 11 (BETA) and a relatively recent iOS device.

Update: I have added basic lighting.

Future (when I get the time): I want to use actual textures and physics based lighting. (And yes I need to enable multisampling I think :-)
