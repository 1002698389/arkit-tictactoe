# arkit-tictactoe
Bjarne Lundgren / bjarne@sent.com / @bjarnel

In this example I have taken the simple scenekit tic-tac-toe (another of my repositories), and tried to put it in ARKit :-)
It works.. somewhat

The aim is this project is just to improve my knowledge of SceneKit and ARKit.

This obviously requires, Xcode 9 (BETA), iOS 11 (BETA) and a relatively recent iOS device.

Update: I have added basic lighting.

Future (when I get the time): make it look more realistic (drop shadows onto floor?)

No with PBR (Physics based rendering/lighting):

Previous version without textures or PBR (just solid colours):

First version without lighting (solid colours + only ambient light = crap):
