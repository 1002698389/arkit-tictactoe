# arkit-tictactoe
Bjarne Lundgren / bjarne@sent.com / @bjarnel

In this example I have taken the simple scenekit tic-tac-toe (another of my repositories), and tried to put it in ARKit :-)
It works.. somewhat

This obviously requires, Xcode 9 (BETA), iOS 11 (BETA) and a relatively recent iOS device.

This is how it looks currently. Very ugly because I haven't fixed lighting yet.
